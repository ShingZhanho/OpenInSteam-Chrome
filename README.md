# OpenInSteam
A Chrome extension that helps you open every Steam page in the Steam client.

## How to use

### Install
1. Proceed to [Chrome Extensions Store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kkghocbcijmjfmgbfhcnooaaipihngea) to install OpenInSteam.
2. (For developers only) You may also download the whole repository and import the unpacked extension in Chrome.
If you don't know how to install an unpacked extension, then this method may not be suitable for you.

### Use
The usage is really straightforward - open any Steam webpage in your browser,
a "Open in Steam clien" button should appear.
Simply click on the button and the Steam client should pop up (if you have installed Steam ofc).
